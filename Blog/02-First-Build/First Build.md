I spent the summer and winter of 2014 working at a small practice in Bristol. We had recently moved to a much larger office in the centre of the city, occupying part of the tenth floor of the iconic Colston Tower. Having moved from a much smaller basement office in Clifton, our new office was left looking a bit empty.

I was tasked with building some computer cabinets to fill the gaps between each workstation, on a very small budget. They had to hold two PCs each, and also deliver power/data. As I was already quite familiar with OpenDesk, I thought I'd carry out an experiment, and see whether an existing design could be adapted to suit my particular conditions. I took the design of a bedside table, by ............, and stretched it around in MicroStation until the opening was large enough to hold two machines. I guess this is quite a primitive adaptation of an existing design, however it demonstrates the principle quite well.

One of the more challenging aspects of this design was to integrate a method of delivering power and data for 8 to 10 PCs. We occupied the office ‘as is,’ and the only existing provision for data was at the perimeter of the room — and we had chosen to have a desk island in the middle. Once again, we were hampered by budget, so had to come up with some alternatives to standard power poles. Nick, my boss, suggested using galvanised steel wire cable trays, and mounting a pair back to back to create an ‘I’ section. We did this, and poked it through the suspended ceiling where it picked up power and data cables. The pole came down from the ceiling, piercing the top of a pair of PC cabinets, where the furniture braced and supported the pole.

I think this experiment was mostly successful, and it encouraged me to continue with my newfound hobby. One of the main things I took away from the experiment is to not underestimate the tolerances of the source material. I intended for the panel joints to be press fit, minimising the time required for assembly and making it simple to assemble in the office. However, some of the sheets used were far over their specified size, approaching 20 mm in thickness! These were far too tight for press fitting, and I resorted to trimming the mortises with a jigsaw on the meeting room table — not ideal. For future project I either need to source a higher quality material, or design for much larger tolerances.
